Manage and sell ticket for an event.

== Description ==

The WPEventTicketing plugin makes it easy to sell tickets to an event directly from your WordPress website.

Contains the following features:

* Collect payments via paypal.
* Set total attendance limit.
* Multiple ticket types. For example, ticket type A includes a t-shirt while ticket type B does not.
* Custom ticket options. This allows you to decide what information you want ticket purchasers to provide. For example, name, address, shirt size, twitter handle, etc...
* Create ticket packages. For example, early bird specials. Ticket packages can be used to give a discount to people who place their order during a certain time.
* Create coupons to give discounts to individuals.
* Send email to purchaser upon order completion.
* Reporting page shows total sales and income broken down by package, coupons used and tickets sold.
* Export attendee data to a CSV file.
* Display a list of event attendees using a shortcode

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How come my tickets aren't showing up for sale on the site? =

The issue is almost always one of 3 things. <a href="https://vimeo.com/29543852">Watch this video</a> and it will explain all 3 scenarios.

= Can I remove the coupon field from the registration page? =

The easiest way to remove the coupon field is to hide it with the following CSS:
`.coupon {
display: none;
}`

= The data entry fields are showing white text in the form fields. How do I fix that? =
This typically happens when you are using a theme with a dark background and white text. The theme designer didn't add a style to force the input fields to use a dark font. You can add the following code to your style.css file:
`#eventTicketing ul.ticketPurchaseInfo li input, 
#eventTicketing tr.coupon input[name="couponCode"] {
color: #000!important;
}`

= Does the plugin create printable tickets? =

Not at this time. But, that's a feature we plan to add in the future.

= Can I run multiple events at one time? =

Not at this time. But, that's a feature we plan to add in the future.
